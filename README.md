# Color Shooter Battle

Sample [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) application that simulates a last-man-standing battle among 4 colors of players. Inspiration from various YouTube videos.

This project is simply a playground used to learn about the Rust language and some of the crates for 2-D graphics.
